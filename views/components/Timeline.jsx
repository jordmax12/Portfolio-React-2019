                        <p> I usually do not do front end projects, but this one was fun because it heavily involved building a "Bejeweled" like algorithm to work on the web. I had a lot of fun with this, because it reminded me of college building out game AI. It was a nice break from the usual development stuff. Getting it to work fast enough for the web was a big struggle, I was able to develop a unique way to check for matches and also built in the ability to make the board as big as the screen without any noticable different in speed of alogirhtm. </p>

A user types in a question or keyword, and the software takes it through the various AI's and displayed data and metadata. For instance, it would tell you the upvote count for each answer we got back (maximum 6). This gave the user the efficiency to type once and search all. </p>
